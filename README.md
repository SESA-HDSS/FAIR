# 🧾 FAIR Metadata Documentation Training

This repository contains materials and resources for the **FAIR Metadata Documentation and De-identification Training**, developed as part of capacity-building efforts for data teams working with health and demographic surveillance data.

## 📌 Overview

This training introduces participants to the **FAIR Data Principles** and provides hands-on experience in **documenting, de-identifying, and publishing research data** using metadata standards and tools such as **Nesstar Publisher**.

The training focuses on **Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS)** contexts but is adaptable for broader use in population health and social science research.
